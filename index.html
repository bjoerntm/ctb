	<h3>Call for papers</h3>
	<p>The workshop on cryptographic tools for blockchains aims at discussing cryptographic mechanisms and their use in distributed ledger technologies. The workshop solicits submissions describing current work addressing decentralized cryptocurrencies and distributed ledger technologies, includ- ing cryptographic schemes and techniques as well as their applications in blockchain protocols, analytical results, work on systems, and/or position papers.</p>

	<p>Topics of interest include, but are not limited to the following techniques and their applications in blockchains:
	<ul>
		<li>Non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs</li>
		<li>Threshold cryptosystems including signatures and encryption</li>
		<li>Verifiable credentials</li>
		<li>Consensus protocols</li>
		<li>Fully homomorphic encryption</li>
		<li>Multi-party computation</li>
		<li>Privacy-preserving smart contracts</li>
		<li>Censorship resistance</li>
		<li>Security of peer-to-peer networks</li>
	</ul>
	Submissions should be written in English, formatted in single-column letter-sized or A4-sized for- mat, and prepared as a PDF file. Submissions have to include: a title, author names and affiliations, and must not exceed eight pages, excluding references. Additional material such as a more detailed description or presentation slides may be added in an optional appendix. Papers must be submitted electronically.</p>
